Rules: 
Always ask before making changes. 
Use existing types, classes, and frameworks. 
Write clean code (no inline styles/functions). 
Document each step’s intention clearly. 
Don’t invent new things without asking.
Create one version that works, no endless fallbacks.
Build up from basic versions to more elaborated ones. 
Don't start with big solutions.
Always use the simplest solution.
Keep code length short but legible.
